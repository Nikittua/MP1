**Generating Flights**
======================

This script generates random flight data and writes it to a file named "flights.txt".

Description
-----------
This script generates random flight data by selecting a random flight number, airline name, arrival date, arrival time, 
and passenger count for a given number of flights. The list of available airline names is stored in the countries list, and the generate_flight function selects one of these names at random to use as the airline name for each flight. The arrival date is selected as a random date within the next year, and the arrival time is selected as a random hour within the day. 
The passenger count is selected as a random number between 22 and 500.
The generate_random_flights function calls the generate_flight function a given number of times to generate a list of flights, and then writes the flight data to a file named "flights.txt" in the format flight_number, airline, arrival_date, arrival_time, passenger_count. The list of flights is also returned by the function.
